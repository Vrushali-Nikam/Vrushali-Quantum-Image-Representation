\noindent
Quantum image processing is the most challenging and attractive area for many researchers.  Quantum image representation (QIR) is necessary for realizing quantum advantages in image processing. However, existing encoding schemes suffer from high qubit demands, prominent gate complexity, and deep circuits and state preparation overhead which makes them unsuitable for near term noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) devices. Moreover, these methods process all image channels uniformly and neglecting perceptual principles that have long enabled efficient compression in classical image and video standards.

In this work, we introduce CS-HQR (Chroma Subsampling Hybrid Quantum Representation), a novel quantum image encoding methodology bridging classical image compression with quantum circuit optimization.CS-HQR leverages YCbCr color space transformation and 4:2:0 chroma subsampling to prioritize luminance information while reducing chrominance redundancy. The dual-circuit architecture encodes luminance at full resolution using 16 qubits while chrominance channels use 15 qubits at quarter resolution, achieving 50\% reduction in encoding complexity while maintaining SSIM above 0.98.

Extensive experimental evaluation using 6,097 medical brain scan slices demonstrates CS-HQR achieves approximately 51\% gate count reduction compared to MCQI, substantial circuit depth reduction, and 75\% chrominance data reduction. Perceptual fidelity is validated via SSIM analysis on a representative 404-image subset, consistently exceeding 0.9999. This method exhibits greater scalability with O($n \cdot 2^n$) complexity, compared to O($2^{2n}$)  for amplitude-based methods. These results demonstrate that integrating classical image processing principles into quantum algorithm design delivers substantial practical benefits for near term quantum computing applications.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

\subsection{Background and Context}
\label{subsec:background}
Image processing constitutes a fundamental component of numerous real-world applications such as medical imaging, remote sensing, autonomous navigation, surveillance systems, and multimedia analytics \cite{ref11}. Classical image processing algorithms often involve computationally intensive operations, including convolution, feature extraction, segmentation, and pattern recognition, which scale poorly with increasing image resolution and dataset size. These limitations have motivated the investigation of quantum computing paradigms that may offer polynomial or exponential speedups for certain classes of image processing problems\cite{ref12}.

Quantum image processing (QIP) covers a broad spectrum of tasks, such as representing quantum images, applying geometric and frequency-domain transformations, enhancing and filtering images, segmenting them, compressing data, and performing classification \cite{ref13}. At its core, QIP harnesses fundamental quantum phenomena including superposition, entanglement, and interference to handle image data in ways that differ intensely from classical methods. Superposition allows multiple pixel values to coexist simultaneously; entanglement links correlations across image elements; and interference enables probability amplitudes to combine constructively or destructively, highlighting key computational results. Measurement collapses quantum superposition by forcing a quantum system from a blend of multiple possible states into one definite outcome, as dictated by the probabilities encoded in its wave function.

A principal theoretical advantage of QIP stems from the exponential dimensionality of quantum state spaces. A quantum register consisting of $n$ qubits exists in a superposition of $2^n$ basis states, making it theoretically possible to encode an entire $2^{n/2} \times 2^{n/2}$ pixel image within a single quantum state \cite{ref14}. Several quantum image representation models have therefore been developed to exploit this exponential representational capacity while still supporting practical image operations. These include the flexible representation of quantum images (FRQI), the novel enhanced quantum representation (NEQR), and various amplitude encoding schemes, all designed to compactly store image data and enable meaningful quantum image manipulations.

Despite these promising theoretical features, putting quantum image processing into practice hits a major roadblock: the quantum image representation challenge. Before any processing can start, classical image data must first get loaded into a suitable quantum state. This preparation step usually calls for a long chain of controlled quantum gates single-qubit gates like Pauli X (bit flip), Y, Z (phase flip), Hadamard (H, creates superposition), S (phase shift), and T, as well as multi-qubit gates such as CNOT (controlled-NOT for entanglement), Toffoli (CCX), SWAP, and controlled-Z (CZ)like that grows with the image size, creating deep circuits and heavy resource demands that often wipe out the speedups from later quantum operations\cite{ref15}.

Image processing constitutes a fundamental component of numerous real-world applications such as medical imaging, remote sensing, autonomous navigation, surveillance systems, and multimedia analytics. Classical image processing algorithms often involve computationally intensive operations, including convolution, feature extraction, segmentation, and pattern recognition, which scale poorly with increasing image resolution and dataset size. These limitations have motivated the investigation of quantum computing paradigms that may offer polynomial or exponential speedups for certain classes of image processing problems.

The efficiency of quantum image encoding therefore plays a critical role in determining the overall feasibility of QIP algorithms. If the preparation of a quantum image state requires $\mathcal{O}(N)$ or more operations for an image with $N$ pixels, then any quantum advantage achieved during later stages must compensate for this initial overhead to yield a net performance gain \cite{ref15}. This issue is further exacerbated in the NISQ era, where limited coherence times, gate errors, and hardware constraints restrict the depth and reliability of quantum circuits. Consequently, ongoing research efforts are increasingly focused on developing efficient and approximate encoding strategies, hybrid quantum--classical frameworks, and problem-specific representations that reduce state preparation costs while preserving the potential advantages of quantum image processing.CS-HQR establishes perceptual awareness as a first-class design principle in quantum state preparation.Despite extensive research on quantum image representations, no prior work incorporates human visual perception models into quantum state preparation. This omission is critical because state preparation dominates computational cost on NISQ devices. CS-HQR directly addresses this gap.

\subsection {Advances in Quantum Image Representation}

The history of quantum image representation spans two decades of incremental refinement. Venegas-Andraca and Bose introduced one of the earliest proposals in 2003, encoding pixel positions and colors through qubit lattice configurations \cite{ref16}. While foundational, this approach required qubits proportional to image size rather than logarithmic, limiting scalability.

The Flexible Representation of Quantum Images (FRQI), proposed by Le et al. in 2011, represented a significant conceptual advance \cite{ref3}. FRQI encodes grayscale pixel intensities as rotation angles applied to a single ``color qubit,'' with position information stored in $n$ position qubits. For a $2^n$-pixel image, FRQI requires only $n+1$ qubits—an exponential improvement in qubit efficiency. The FRQI quantum state is expressed as:

\begin{equation}
\ket{I} = \frac{1}{2^n} \sum_{i=0}^{2^{2n}-1} \left(\cos\theta_i\ket{0} + \sin\theta_i\ket{1}\right) \otimes \ket{i}
\label{eq:frqi}
\end{equation}

where $\theta_i = \frac{\pi \cdot I_i}{2 \times 255}$ encodes the grayscale intensity $I_i$ of pixel $i$.

Despite its elegance, FRQI suffers from significant practical limitations. The preparation circuit requires $O(2^{2n})$ controlled rotation gates, each conditioned on a unique position state. For a modest 16×16 image (256 pixels), this translates to approximately 65,536 controlled operations—far exceeding the coherent operation capacity of current quantum hardware \cite{ref17}.

The Novel Enhanced Quantum Representation (NEQR), introduced by Zhang et al. in 2013, addressed FRQI's gate complexity through digital encoding \cite{ref4}. NEQR represents pixel intensities as binary strings in computational basis states rather than rotation angles:

\begin{equation}
\ket{I} = \frac{1}{2^n} \sum_{i=0}^{2^{2n}-1} \ket{C_i} \otimes \ket{i}
\label{eq:neqr}
\end{equation}

where $\ket{C_i} = \ket{c_i^{q-1} c_i^{q-2} \cdots c_i^0}$ represents the $q$-bit binary encoding of pixel intensity. NEQR achieves linear gate complexity $O(q \cdot 2^{2n})$ but requires additional qubits ($n + q$ total), trading qubit count for circuit depth.

Subsequent developments introduced specialized representations for various image types. The Generalized Quantum Image Representation (GQIR) by Jiang et al. \cite{ref18} provided flexible bit-depth encoding. Multi-Channel Quantum Images (MCQI) by Sun et al. \cite{ref8} extended NEQR to color images by concatenating RGB channel qubits. Quantum Log-polar Representation (QLR) \cite{ref19} introduced coordinate transformations for rotation-invariant applications.

\subsection{Challenges in Existing Quantum Image Representations}
Existing QIR methods primarily focus on compact mathematical formulations or deterministic pixel retrieval, but they share two fundamental limitations. First, many QIR methods especially amplitude-based methods such as FRQI shows exponential gate complexity during state preparation, rendering them impractical for images beyond very small resolutions. Basis-state encodings such as NEQR alleviate this issue by trading gate depth for additional qubits, yet still impose substantial circuit overhead when extended to color images.

Second, and more critically, current QIR schemes treat all image information uniformly, encoding red, green, and blue channels at identical spatial resolutions. This design choice directly contradicts well established principles of human visual perception. Decades of psychophysical research demonstrate that the human visual system is far more sensitive to luminance variations than to high-frequency chrominance facts. Classical image and video compression standards including JPEG, MPEG, and H.264/HEVC develop this asymmetry through chroma subsampling, achieving lower reductions in data size with negligible perceptual degradation. So, this perceptual redundancy has not been systematically included into quantum image representations. As a result, existing multi-channel methods such as MCQI and QRMW acquire unnecessary qubit and gate overhead by encoding perceptually redundant chrominance information at full resolution. This inadequacy is particularly degrading on NISQ devices, where each additional multi-controlled gate substantially increases the probability of decoherence and execution failure \cite{ref6}.

Table \ref{tab:existing_limitations} summarizes the key limitations of major QIR methods:

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Limitations of Existing QIR Methods}
\label{tab:existing_limitations}
\begin{tabular}{@{}lp{5.5cm}@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Method} & \textbf{Primary Limitations} \\
\midrule
FRQI & Exponential gate complexity $O(2^{2n})$; impractical for images $>$ 8×8 \\
NEQR & Linear but still substantial gate requirements; no compression \\
GQIR & Arbitrary bit-depth but uniform treatment of all pixels \\
MCQI & Tripled resource requirements for color; no perceptual optimization \\
EFRQI & Improved FRQI but retains amplitude encoding limitations \\
QRMW & Multi-controlled operations significantly increase circuit complexity for Multi Wavelength Images \\
BRQI & A Bitplane Representation of Quantum Images has high qubit cost with less perceptual significance \\
QPIE & Lossy; significant information loss for complex images \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The MCQI method demonstrates this redundancy for color images. By encoding RGB channels independently at full resolution, MCQI requires encoding $3 \times 2^{2n}$ pixel values. For a 16×16 color image, this means 768 values requiring approximately 7,000+ quantum gates \cite{ref20}. However, human vision cannot resolve full-resolution chrominance detail preserved by MCQI, rendering these additional resources inefficient for encoding perceptually superfluous information.

\subsection{Perceptual Redundancy in Color Images}

The human visual system (HVS) exhibits markedly different sensitivity to luminance (brightness) and chrominance (color) information \cite{ref7}. This differential sensitivity arises from the physiology of retinal photoreceptors: approximately 95\% of retinal cells are rods (luminance-sensitive) concentrated in peripheral vision, while only 5\% are cones (color-sensitive) concentrated in the fovea.

Psycho physical research demonstrates that human vision can resolve luminance detail up to around 60 cycles per degree of visual angle. In contrast, chrominance sensitivity declines sharply beyond 8–12 cycles per degree. Therefore, reducing chrominance resolution by a factor of two to four does not produce noticeable degradation in perceived image quality under typical observing conditions.

Classical image compression methods produce the benefits of reduced sensitivity of the human visual system to chrominance details by engaging chroma subsampling. A widely accepted system is the 4:2:0 format, in which the chrominance components are sampled at one-quarter of the luminance resolution, corresponding to half the resolution in each spatial dimension. This process is enabled by the YCbCr color space, which effectively separates the luminance (Y) information from the chrominance components (Cb and Cr), thereby enabling efficient compression without a distinguishable loss of visual quality:

\begin{align}
Y &= 0.299R + 0.587G + 0.114B \label{eq:y}\\
C_b &= 128 - 0.168736R - 0.331264G + 0.5B \label{eq:cb}\\
C_r &= 128 + 0.5R - 0.418688G - 0.081312B \label{eq:cr}
\end{align}

This transformation, combined with 4:2:0 subsampling, reduces color image data to 50\% of the original RGB representation while maintaining perceptual quality metrics (SSIM) above 0.98 for typical images \cite{ref22}.

\subsection{Scope and Impact}
\label{subsec:scope}

This study addresses practical strategies for color image encoding on near-term quantum devices, with particular emphasis on medical imaging applications where perceptual fidelity is critical. To ensure compatibility with the constraints of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware and to enable systematic evaluation across diverse datasets, our experiments employ a 16×16 evaluation grid \cite{ref4}. The proposed CS-HQR framework, however, is not limited to this resolution; it generalizes naturally to larger images through block-wise tiling or hierarchical encoding. In this approach, high-resolution images are partitioned into sub blocks (e.g., 16×16 or 32×32 tiles), which are independently encoded and processed before being recombined in the classical domain. Two practical tiling strategies are considered:
Fixed tiling, in which non-overlapping tiles are encoded independently, thereby minimizing classical recomposition overhead. Overlapping or multi-scale tiling, which employs overlapping tiles or pyramid schemes to enhance edge continuity and mitigate boundary artifacts\cite{ref22}.
Both strategies retain the perceptual subsampling benefits of CS-HQR while distributing quantum resource demands across multiple circuits or execution epochs. For block-wise execution on resource-constrained hardware, tiles may be processed sequentially or, where multiple devices or back-ends are available, in parallel. This design ensures scalability while maintaining perceptual quality, making the approach particularly suitable for medical imaging tasks in near-term quantum environments.

Technical rationale: CS-HQR explicitly prioritizes luminance (Y) over chrominance (Cb, Cr) because human visual perception and many diagnostic algorithms are far more sensitive to luminance structure than to high-frequency chrominance content. Allocating full-resolution encoding resources to luminance and subsampling chrominance reduces the number of encoded values by ~50\%
(Section~\ref{sec:proposed_method}) while retaining perceptual quality. Reconstruction uses standard upsampling techniques (bilinear by default; bicubic optional for higher-frequency chrominance), and the resulting visual fidelity is quantified via SSIM and complemented by pixel-wise metrics (MSE/PSNR) in Section~\ref{sec:results}.

The preprocessing pipeline employed in this study comprises intensity normalization, image resizing, color space conversion, and light data augmentations. Augmentations include small rotations and horizontal/vertical flips, which are applied exclusively during training and robustness evaluation. Rotation and flipping are classical, lossless operations (provided metadata is preserved) that enhance both model and methodological robustness. Importantly, these transformations do not alter the CS-HQR encoding design. However, they do modify the spatial statistics of the input data, which in turn can influence the effectiveness of chroma subsampling. Consequently, practitioners are advised to empirically validate the trade-offs between structural similarity index (SSIM) and mean squared error (MSE) on domain-specific datasets to ensure optimal performance.

Noise and hardware considerations: CS-HQR reduces overall MCX/CNOT counts through chroma subsampling, which directly lowers cumulative two-qubit error exposure on NISQ devices. Moreover, because most perceptual information resides in the luminance channel, small errors in chrominance qubits caused by hardware noise typically result in imperceptible visual changes—this provides an additional, practical layer of robustness for noisy hardware (see Section~\ref{sec:results} for Monte Carlo simulations including common noise models).

Limitations and applicability: CS-HQR is a perceptually-driven, lossy encoding and is therefore unsuitable where bit-exact reconstruction is required (e.g., forensic imaging, some scientific imaging pipelines). It is best suited to applications where human interpretation or higher-level feature extraction (segmentation, classification) tolerate small chrominance deviations. For images with highly informative color texture (e.g., certain histopathology or multispectral remote sensing), adaptive subsampling ratios (4:2:2 or 4:4:4) should be considered.

Evaluation and integration notes: In Section~\ref{sec:results} we report SSIM, MSE, and PSNR across the dataset to quantify both perceptual and absolute errors. Practitioners integrating CS-HQR into existing pipelines can adopt a staged approach: (1) apply YCbCr conversion and chroma subsampling classically and evaluate downstream task impact, (2) implement block-wise quantum encoding for luminance only as a first quantum step, and (3) progressively introduce chrominance quantum encodings when hardware permits. This incremental path minimizes integration risk and allows immediate classical validation before committing scarce quantum resources.

In summary, the expanded introduction delineates CS-HQR's practical benefits, the technical rationale for its design choices, its generalizability to larger images and diverse domains, and the key trade-offs for practitioners.

\section{Motivation}
\label{sec:motivation}

The connection of quantum computing and image processing represents a promising frontier in computational science. With global healthcare imaging data projected to exceed 2,314 exabytes by 2026 \cite{ref1}. the computational demands of processing, analyzing, and transmitting medical images increasingly strain classical infrastructure. Quantum computing offers a paradigm shift through its inherent parallelism—where $n$ qubits represent $2^n$ states simultaneously—potentially delivering exponential speedups for specific image processing tasks \cite{ref2}.

However, realizing quantum advantages necessitates efficient encoding of classical images into quantum states a challenge that current quantum image representation (QIR) methods have yet to resolve adequately. Methods like FRQI \cite{ref3}and NEQR \cite{ref4} prioritize theoretical elegance over practical constraints. While FRQI uses just $n+1$ qubits for $2^n$ pixels, its circuit depth scales as $O(2^{2n})$ gates, making it infeasible for images beyond 8×8 pixels on current hardware \cite{ref5}.NEQR proposals linear gate complexity but requires extra qubits for color encoding

A key insight motivating this work is that existing QIR methods supervise decades of perceptual image processing research. Classical standards such as JPEG, MPEG-2, H.264, and HEVC achieve excellent compression ratios by exploiting human vision's greater sensitivity to luminance than chrominance \cite{ref6}. With approximately 120 million rod cells for brightness detection versus just 6 million cone cells for color, this asymmetry enables efficient chroma subsampling in compression algorithms \cite{ref7}.

This biological insight has never been applied systematically to quantum image representation. Current multi-channel methods like MCQI \cite{ref8} treat red, green, and blue channels identically, encoding each at full resolution despite the perceptual redundancy this introduces. For a 16×16 color image, MCQI requires encoding 768 pixel values (256 per channel), while a perceptually equivalent representation requires only 384 values using 4:2:0 subsampling.

Our motivation extends beyond theoretical interest to practical necessity. The current era of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices imposes severe constraints: IBM's largest publicly accessible quantum processors offer approximately 127 qubits with coherence times measured in microseconds and two-qubit gate error rates around 1\% \cite{ref9}. Every unnecessary gate increases the probability of decoherence-induced errors, making circuit optimization not merely desirable but essential for meaningful quantum computation.

Medical imaging represents a particularly encouraging domain for the application of quantum image processing. In radiology, diagnostic accuracy analytically depends on the preservation of clinically relevant features, even under the computational constraints enforced by high-resolution imaging modalities \cite{ref10}. The different tasks such as brain MRI analysis, tumor recognition, and radiomics necessitate processing pipelines that maintain diagnostic fidelity, with performance criteria more closely allied to perceptual quality metrics such as the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), rather than strict pixel-level reconstruction accuracy.

CS-HQR emerges from the recognition that quantum algorithm design should incorporate domain-specific knowledge rather than considering all data uniformly. By connecting recognized principles from classical signal processing with quantum circuit optimization, we demonstrate that significant practical improvements are achievable without sacrificing the theoretical foundations of quantum image representation.

\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:related_work}
This section provides a comprehensive survey of existing quantum image representation techniques. For clarity, we categorize these approaches into three principal groups according to their encoding strategies: (i) amplitude-based methods, (ii) basis state encoding methods, and (iii) hybrid or specialized methods. Within each category, we systematically present the mathematical formulation, the corresponding quantum circuit architecture, and the associated computational complexity. This structured analysis enables a comparative understanding of the strengths and limitations inherent in each encoding paradigm, thereby offering insights into their applicability across diverse quantum image processing tasks.

\subsection{Amplitude-Based Encoding Methods}

Amplitude-based methods encode pixel information in the probability amplitudes of quantum states, achieving high qubit efficiency at the cost of complex state preparation circuits.

\subsubsection{FRQI: Flexible Representation of Quantum Images}

The Flexible Representation of Quantum Images (FRQI), introduced by Le et al. \cite{ref3}, represents the foundational work in quantum image representation. FRQI encodes grayscale pixel intensities as rotation angles on a single color qubit, with position information stored in $n$ position qubits.

\textbf{Mathematical Formulation:}
For an image of size $2^n \times 2^n$ pixels, the FRQI state is defined as:

\begin{equation}
\ket{I}_{\text{FRQI}} = \frac{1}{2^n} \sum_{i=0}^{2^{2n}-1} \left(\cos\theta_i\ket{0} + \sin\theta_i\ket{1}\right) \otimes \ket{i}
\label{eq:frqi_state}
\end{equation}

where $\theta_i = \frac{\pi \cdot I_i}{2 \times 255}$ maps the grayscale intensity $I_i \in [0, 255]$ to an angle $\theta_i \in [0, \frac{\pi}{2}]$. The position state $\ket{i}$ encodes the pixel coordinates in binary.
Figure~\ref{fig:frqi_example} illustrates how a simple 2×2 image is represented in FRQI, where each pixel's grayscale intensity is encoded as a rotation angle $\theta$.

\textbf{Circuit Architecture:}
The FRQI preparation circuit consists of three stages:

\begin{figure}[H]

\caption{FRQI Encoding Circuit for 2×2 Quantum Image: Pixel intensities encoded via position-controlled $R_y(\theta_i)$ rotations on basis states.
}
\label{fig:frqi_circuit}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Complexity Analysis:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Qubits Required: $2n + 1$ for a $2^n \times 2^n$ image
    \item Gate Count: $O(2^{2n})$ controlled rotations
    \item Circuit Depth: $O(2^{2n})$
\end{itemize}

The exponential gate complexity renders FRQI impractical for images larger than 8×8 pixels on current hardware.

\subsubsection{EFRQI: Enhanced Flexible Representation of Quantum Images}

The Enhanced FRQI (EFRQI) \cite{ref32} improves upon FRQI by quantizing rotation angles to discrete levels, reducing the number of unique rotation operations required.

\textbf{Mathematical Formulation:}
EFRQI quantizes pixel values to $q$ levels:

\begin{equation}
\theta_i^{\text{EFRQI}} = \frac{\pi \cdot \lfloor I_i / (256/q) \rfloor}{2 \times (q-1)}
\label{eq:efrqi}
\end{equation}

For $q = 32$ levels, this reduces unique rotation angles from 256 to 32, enabling circuit optimization through gate merging.

\textbf{Circuit Architecture:}

\end{quantikz}
\caption{EFRQI circuit with quantized rotation angles $\phi \in \{\phi_1, \phi_2, ..., \phi_q\}$.}

\textbf{Complexity Analysis:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Qubits Required: $2n + 1$ (same as FRQI)
    \item Gate Count: $O(q \cdot 2^{2n})$ where $q \ll 256$
    \item Trade-off: Reduced precision for improved gate efficiency
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{QPIE: Quantum Probability Image Encoding}

Quantum Probability Image Encoding (QPIE) \cite{ref24} achieves maximum qubit efficiency by encoding normalized pixel values directly as probability amplitudes.

\textbf{Mathematical Formulation:}
\begin{equation}
\ket{I}_{\text{QPIE}} = \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} \alpha_i \ket{i}, \quad \text{where } \alpha_i = \frac{I_i}{\sqrt{\sum_{j=0}^{N-1} I_j^2}}
\label{eq:qpie}
\end{equation}

The normalization constraint $\sum_i |\alpha_i|^2 = 1$ ensures valid quantum state representation.

\end{equation}

where $\ket{C_{yx}} = \ket{c_{yx}^{q-1} c_{yx}^{q-2} \cdots c_{yx}^0}$ represents the $q$-bit binary encoding of the grayscale intensity at position $(y, x)$.

For 8-bit grayscale: $C_{yx} = \sum_{k=0}^{7} c_{yx}^k \cdot 2^k$

\subsection{Transform-Domain and Specialized Methods}

These methods incorporate classical signal processing transformations into quantum representations.

\subsubsection{DCT-QIR: Discrete Cosine Transform Quantum Image Representation}

DCT-based Quantum Image Representation (DCT-QIR) \cite{ref25} encodes DCT coefficients rather than spatial pixel values, enabling lossy compression within the quantum representation.

\textbf{Mathematical Formulation:}
The DCT transformation converts spatial domain to frequency domain:
\begin{multline}
F(u,v) = \alpha(u)\alpha(v) \sum_{x=0}^{N-1} \sum_{y=0}^{N-1} f(x,y) =  \cos\frac{(2x+1)u\pi}{2N} \cos\frac{(2y+1)v\pi}{2N}
\label{eq:dct}
\end{multline}

The quantum state encodes only significant coefficients:
\begin{equation}
\ket{I}_{\text{DCT-QIR}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{K}} \sum_{k=0}^{K-1} \ket{F_k} \otimes \ket{u_k, v_k}
\label{eq:dct_qir}

    \item Trade-off: Lossy compression; suitable for approximate processing
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{QLR: Quantum Log-polar Representation}

Quantum Log-polar Representation (QLR), often implemented as the Quantum Log-polar Image (QUALPI) model, encodes classical images sampled in log-polar coordinates into quantum states. This uses three qubit sequences to store gray-scale values, log-radius positions $\rho &= \log\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$ \\ and  polar angles $(\theta)$, enabling normalized superposition of all pixels for parallel processing.

\textbf{Mathematical Formulation:}
Log-polar transformation:
\begin{align}
\rho &= \log\sqrt{(x-x_c)^2 + (y-y_c)^2} \\
\phi &= \arctan\frac{y-y_c}{x-x_c}
\end{align}

Quantum state:
\begin{equation}
\ket{I}_{\text{QLR}} = \frac{1}{2^n} \sum_{\rho,\phi} \ket{C_{\rho\phi}} \otimes \ket{\rho} \otimes \ket{\phi}

\subsection{Research Gap Analysis}
A comprehensive review of the QIR literature reveals a critical gap \textbf {no existing method leverages perceptual redundancy in color images}. Multi-channel techniques, including MCQI and QRMW, process RGB channels uniformly, despite psychophysical evidence that chrominance signals tolerate substantial subsampling relative to luminance with negligible perceptual loss \cite{ref4, ref8}.
We address this gap with CS-HQR, a method that integrates classical compression principles into quantum circuit design. Employing YCbCr transformation and 4:2:0 chroma subsampling—standards from JPEG and MPEG—CS-HQR reduces quantum resource demands while ensuring visually lossless reconstruction, thereby advancing efficient quantum image representations.

The following section formally defines our research contributions and the problem statement.

\section{Research Objectives and Contributions}
\label{sec:contribution}

This research makes the following significant objectives and contributions to the field of quantum image processing
This study presents CS-HQR (Chroma Subsampling Hybrid Quantum Representation), a novel framework for quantum image encoding that integrates perceptual optimization principles directly into the design of quantum circuits. The vital research objectives of this work are articulated as follows:

\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{O\arabic*:}]
    \item Develop a quantum image representation that exploits perceptual redundancy in color images through YCbCr transformation and chroma subsampling
    \item Design and Implement a hybrid circuit architecture that enables efficient parallel encoding of luminance and chrominance components
    \item Establish a comprehensive evaluation framework with ten quantitative parameters for fair comparison of QIR methods
    \item Test and Validate the proposed method on medical imaging data with clinical relevance considerations
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Primary Contributions}

\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{C\arabic*:}]
    \item \textbf{First Perceptual Color Space Integration in QIR:} We introduce the first quantum image representation that explicitly incorporates human visual perception characteristics through YCbCr color space transformation. This represents a paradigm shift from treating all image data uniformly to intelligently allocating quantum resources based on perceptual importance.
    
    \item \textbf{Novel Chroma Subsampling for Quantum Circuits:} We adapt the 4:2:0 chroma subsampling scheme a cornerstone of JPEG/MPEG compression to quantum circuit design. This reduces chrominance data by 75\% while maintaining SSIM $>$ 0.98, achieving substantial gate reduction without perceptible quality loss.
    
    \item \textbf{Hybrid Dual-Circuit Architecture:} We design a parallel circuit architecture where:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Circuit A (Luminance):} Encodes the Y channel at full 16×16 resolution using 16 qubits
        \item \textbf{Circuit B (Chrominance):} Encodes Cb and Cr channels at 8×8 resolution using 15 qubits with a channel selection qubit
    \end{itemize}
    This enables simultaneous encoding with maximum qubit utilization of only 16 qubits.
    
    \item \textbf{Comprehensive 10-Parameter Evaluation Framework:} We establish a rigorous benchmarking methodology encompassing qubit efficiency, gate complexity, circuit depth, encoding time, scalability, information preservation, compression ratio, memory overhead, gate complexity per qubit, and implementation complexity.
    
    \item \textbf{Extensive Empirical Validation:} We evaluate 12 methods across 6,097 medical images for overall circuit/encoding metrics, with detailed SSIM distribution and paired statistical testing conducted on a 404-image subset.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Theoretical Contributions}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Formal proof that perceptually-weighted encoding achieves equivalent visual quality with reduced quantum resources
    \item Complexity analysis demonstrating CS-HQR's $O(n \cdot 2^n)$ scaling versus $O(3 \cdot 2^{2n})$ for standard MCQI
    \item Mathematical framework for color space transformation in quantum state preparation
\end{itemize}

    \item The preparation circuit $\mathcal{C}_{\mathcal{P}}$ minimizes the objective function:
    \begin{equation}
    \min_{\mathcal{P}} \left[ \alpha \cdot Q(\mathcal{C}_{\mathcal{P}}) + \beta \cdot G(\mathcal{C}_{\mathcal{P}}) + \gamma \cdot D(\mathcal{C}_{\mathcal{P}}) \right]
    \label{eq:optimization}
    \end{equation}
    subject to $\text{SSIM}(\mathbf{I}, \hat{\mathbf{I}}) \geq \tau$
\end{enumerate}

where $Q(\cdot)$, $G(\cdot)$, $D(\cdot)$ represent the qubit count, total gate count, and circuit depth respectively, and $\alpha, \beta, \gamma \in [0,1]$ are weighting coefficients satisfying $\alpha + \beta + \gamma = 1$.


\subsection{Mathematical Formulation for Color Space Transformation}

\subsubsection{RGB to YCbCr Transformation}
The RGB to YCbCr transformation translates an image from the RGB color space (red, green, blue channels) into YCbCr (luma + chroma channels). This splits brightness (Y) from color information (Cb, Cr), supporting more efficient compression and processing in video and image systems.The RGB color space treats all channels equally, which is suboptimal for human perception. We transform to YCbCr space where luminance (Y) and chrominance (Cb, Cr) are separated:

\begin{equation}
\begin{bmatrix} Y \\ C_b \\ C_r \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 0.299 & 0.587 & 0.114 \\ -0.168736 & -0.331264 & 0.5 \\ 0.5 & -0.418688 & -0.081312 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} R \\ G \\ B \end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 128 \\ 128 \end{bmatrix}
\label{eq:rgb_to_ycbcr}
\end{equation}

This transformation is derived from the ITU-R BT.601 standard and reflects the luminance sensitivity of the human visual system.

\subsubsection{Inverse Transformation for Reconstruction}

The inverse transformation recovers RGB values:

\begin{equation}
\begin{bmatrix} R \\ G \\ B \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 1.402 \\ 1 & -0.344136 & -0.714136 \\ 1 & 1.772 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} Y \\ C_b - 128 \\ C_r - 128 \end{bmatrix}
\label{eq:ycbcr_to_rgb}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Chroma Subsampling Formulation}

\subsubsection{4:2:0 Subsampling Scheme}

The 4:2:0 chroma subsampling reduces chrominance resolution by half in both horizontal and vertical dimensions:

\begin{equation}
C_b^{sub}(i,j) = \frac{1}{4}\sum_{m=0}^{1}\sum_{n=0}^{1} C_b(2i+m, 2j+n)
\label{eq:cb_subsample}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
C_r^{sub}(i,j) = \frac{1}{4}\sum_{m=0}^{1}\sum_{n=0}^{1} C_r(2i+m, 2j+n)
\label{eq:cr_subsample}
\end{equation}

For an $N \times N$ image:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Luminance Y: $N \times N$ pixels (full resolution)
    \item Chrominance $C_b^{sub}$: $\frac{N}{2} \times \frac{N}{2}$ pixels
    \item Chrominance $C_r^{sub}$: $\frac{N}{2} \times \frac{N}{2}$ pixels
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Data Reduction Analysis}

For a 16×16 color image:

\caption{4:2:0 Chroma Subsampling for Reduced Data Representation}
\label{tab:data_reduction}
\begin{tabular}{@{}lccc@{}}

\midrule
\textbf{Total} & \textbf{768} & \textbf{384} & \textbf{50\%} \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Quantum State Formulation}

\subsubsection{CS-HQR State Definition}

The CS-HQR quantum state consists of two parallel components:

\textbf{Circuit A - Luminance State:}
\begin{equation}
\ket{Y} = \frac{1}{2^n} \sum_{i=0}^{2^{2n}-1} \ket{Y_i^7 Y_i^6 \cdots Y_i^0} \otimes \ket{i}
\label{eq:luma_state}
\end{equation}

where $n = 4$ for 16×16 images, giving 256 pixel positions with 8-bit luminance encoding.

\textbf{Circuit B - Chrominance State:}
\begin{equation}
\ket{CbCr} = \frac{1}{2^{n-1}} \sum_{j=0}^{2^{2(n-1)}-1} \left( \ket{C_j^7 \cdots C_j^0} \otimes \ket{j} \otimes \ket{ch} \right)
\label{eq:chroma_state}
\end{equation}

where $\ket{ch} \in \{\ket{0}, \ket{1}\}$ selects between $C_b$ and $C_r$ channels, and $j$ indexes the $\frac{N}{2} \times \frac{N}{2} = 64$ subsampled positions.

\textbf{Combined CS-HQR State:}
\begin{equation}
\ket{I}_{CS-HQR} = \ket{Y} \otimes \ket{CbCr}
\label{eq:cshqr_combined}
\end{equation}

Note: In practice, Circuits A and B execute in parallel on separate qubit registers or sequentially on the same register.This separation allows luminance and chrominance to be encoded with different spatial resolutions while preserving compatibility with NEQR-style deterministic retrieval

\subsection{Complexity Analysis}

\subsubsection{Qubit Complexity}

\begin{equation}
Q_{CS-HQR} = \max(Q_A, Q_B) = \max(2n + 8, 2(n-1) + 8 + 1)
\label{eq:qubit_complexity}
\end{equation}

For $n = 4$ (16×16 image):
\begin{align}
Q_A &= 8 + 8 = 16 \text{ qubits (position + color)} \\
Q_B &= 6 + 8 + 1 = 15 \text{ qubits (position + color + channel)}
\end{align}

Therefore, $Q_{CS-HQR} = 16$ qubits (parallel execution).

\subsubsection{Gate Complexity}

For NEQR-style basis state encoding:
\begin{equation}
G_{NEQR}(N, q) = O(q \cdot N^2 \cdot H(I))
\label{eq:neqr_gates}
\end{equation}

where $H(I)$ is the average Hamming weight of pixel values.

For CS-HQR:
\begin{align}
G_A &= O(8 \cdot 256 \cdot H(Y)) \approx 2048 \cdot H(Y) \\
G_B &= O(8 \cdot 128 \cdot H(C)) \approx 1024 \cdot H(C)
\end{align}

\begin{equation}
G_{CS-HQR} = G_A + G_B \approx 3072 \cdot \bar{H}
\label{eq:cshqr_gates}
\end{equation}

Compared to MCQI:
\begin{equation}
G_{MCQI} = O(24 \cdot 256 \cdot H(RGB)) \approx 6144 \cdot \bar{H}
\label{eq:mcqi_gates}
\end{equation}

\textbf{Gate Reduction Ratio:}
\begin{equation}
\eta_G = 1 - \frac{G_{CS-HQR}}{G_{MCQI}} = 1 - \frac{3072}{6144} = 50\%
\label{eq:gate_reduction}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Circuit Depth Analysis}

Sequential encoding depth:
\begin{equation}
D_{CS-HQR} = D_A + D_B \approx \frac{G_A}{w_A} + \frac{G_B}{w_B}
\label{eq:depth}
\end{equation}

where $w_A, w_B$ are parallelization widths.

Parallel execution depth (with sufficient qubits):
\begin{equation}
D_{CS-HQR}^{parallel} = \max(D_A, D_B)
\label{eq:parallel_depth}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Perceptual Quality Guarantee}

\subsubsection{SSIM Analysis}

Unlike PSNR or MSE, SSIM is aligned with human perceptual judgment, which directly motivates CS-HQR’s design. Therefore, SSIM is not only the exact bit reconstruction but also the appropriate success criterion for NISQ-oriented quantum image representations.The Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) between original $\mathbf{I}$ and reconstructed $\hat{\mathbf{I}}$ is:

\begin{equation}
\text{SSIM}(\mathbf{I}, \hat{\mathbf{I}}) = \frac{(2\mu_I\mu_{\hat{I}} + c_1)(2\sigma_{I\hat{I}} + c_2)}{(\mu_I^2 + \mu_{\hat{I}}^2 + c_1)(\sigma_I^2 + \sigma_{\hat{I}}^2 + c_2)}
\label{eq:ssim}
\end{equation}

For CS-HQR with bilinear interpolation of chrominance:
\begin{equation}
\text{SSIM}_{CS-HQR} \geq 0.98 \text{ (empirically validated)}
\label{eq:ssim_bound}
\end{equation}

This threshold exceeds the just-noticeable-difference (JND) threshold for human perception, ensuring perceptually lossless quality.

\section{Dataset Description}
\label{sec:dataset}

\subsection{NIST-MNI Medical Imaging Dataset}
\label{subsec:nist_mni}

Our experiments employ the NIST-MNI brain imaging dataset \cite{ref43,ref44}, a standardized benchmark comprising 1,000+ T1-weighted MRI scans  from healthy adult subjects. Curated by the Montreal Neurological Institute and calibrated by NIST for medical imaging benchmarks, this dataset supports rigorous assessment of quantum image representation fidelity under perceptual constraints

\subsubsection{Dataset Characteristics}

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{NIST-MNI Dataset Specifications}
\label{tab:dataset}
\begin{tabular}{@{}ll@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Attribute} & \textbf{Value} \\
\midrule
Total Images (after QC) & 6,097 \\

\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Local Dataset Organization (\texttt{group4} Folder)}
All experiments in this study use the locally organized dataset folder \texttt{group4/}, structured into 13 subject/group subfolders (\texttt{01}--\texttt{13}) containing MINC slice files under \texttt{2D/}. The raw \texttt{group4} directory contains 6,122 \texttt{.mnc} files; after preprocessing and quality-control filtering (removing blank or corrupted slices), 6,097 slices are retained for evaluation.

\subsubsection{MINC File Format}

The Medical Imaging NetCDF (MINC) format is a hierarchical data format designed for medical imaging applications. Key features include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Self-describing format with embedded metadata
    \item Support for multi-dimensional data (3D/4D volumes)
    \item Standardized coordinate systems for neuroimaging
    \item Lossless compression support
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Preprocessing Pipeline}

Each image undergoes the following preprocessing:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Slice Extraction:} Extract 2D axial slices from 3D volumes
    \item \textbf{Resizing:} Bilinear interpolation to 16×16 pixels
    \item \textbf{Normalization:} Scale intensities to [0, 255] range
    \item \textbf{Color Conversion:} Convert grayscale to RGB (for fair comparison with color methods)
    \item \textbf{Quality Control:} Remove blank or corrupted slices
    \item \textbf{Data Augmentation:} Apply simple augmentations such as small rotations (e.g., $\pm 15^\circ$) and horizontal/vertical flipping where appropriate to increase sample diversity
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Justification for Dataset Selection}

Medical imaging provides an ideal test domain for CS-HQR because:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Clinical Relevance:} Brain MRI is a high-value application where quantum speedups could provide tangible benefits
    \item \textbf{Perceptual Requirements:} Diagnostic accuracy depends on preserving clinically relevant features, aligning with SSIM-based evaluation
    \item \textbf{Standardization:} NIST-MNI provides reproducible benchmarking with established ground truth
    \item \textbf{Image Characteristics:} Medical images exhibit spatial correlations that benefit from intelligent encoding strategies
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Rationale for Grayscale-to-Color Conversion}

A critical design decision in our experimental methodology is the conversion of originally grayscale medical images to RGB color space. This choice is motivated by \textbf{benchmarking fairness} rather than clinical necessity. Since CS-HQR is specifically designed for color image encoding and our primary comparison targets (MCQI, QRMW, EFRQI-color) are color-capable methods, evaluating all methods on identical color inputs ensures an equitable comparison. Simply using grayscale images would unfairly disadvantage color methods while artificially favoring grayscale-only encodings (NEQR, GQIR) that cannot scale to real-world color imaging scenarios. The grayscale-to-RGB conversion replicates intensity values across all three channels ($R = G = B = Y$), creating a controlled test case where the ``ground truth'' color information is perfectly correlated. This approach isolates the algorithmic efficiency of each encoding method from confounding factors such as natural color image statistics. Furthermore, modern medical imaging increasingly incorporates color information through pseudo-coloring, multi-modal fusion, and functional overlays, making color encoding capability clinically relevant for future applications.

\section{Proposed Method: CS-HQR (Chroma Subsampling Hybrid Quantum Representation)}
\label{sec:proposed_method}

This section presents the complete CS-HQR (Chroma Subsampling Hybrid Quantum Representation) methodology, including the theoretical foundation, algorithm design, and circuit implementation.

\subsection{Overview and Design Philosophy}
\label{subsec:overview}

CS-HQR is founded on three key principles:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Perceptual Optimization:} Allocate quantum resources proportionally to perceptual importance
    \item \textbf{Classical-Quantum Bridging:} Leverage proven classical compression techniques in quantum circuit design
    \item \textbf{NISQ Practicality:} Design for near-term quantum hardware constraints
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Motivation for Perceptual-Based Encoding}

The human visual system (HVS) exhibits fundamental asymmetries in color perception that have been extensively studied in psychophysical research. The retina contains approximately 120 million rod photoreceptors sensitive to luminance but only 6-7 million cone photoreceptors for color vision. This biological architecture results in significantly higher spatial acuity for brightness variations compared to color variations.

Classical image and video compression standards have exploited this perceptual redundancy for decades:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{JPEG (1992):} Uses 4:2:0 chroma subsampling as default
    \item \textbf{MPEG-2 (1995):} Standardized chroma subsampling for video
    \item \textbf{H.264/AVC (2003):} Maintains 4:2:0 as primary format
    \item \textbf{H.265/HEVC (2013):} Supports 4:2:0, 4:2:2, and 4:4:4
    \item \textbf{AV1 (2018):} Continues the 4:2:0 paradigm
\end{itemize}

The remarkable success of these standards—compressing images and video by factors of 10-100× with imperceptible quality loss—demonstrates that perceptual optimization is not merely theoretical but practically validated at planetary scale. CS-HQR represents the first systematic application of these principles to quantum image representation.

\subsection{Theoretical Foundation}

\subsubsection{Perceptual Information Theory}

Let $H_{perc}(\mathbf{I})$ denote the perceptual information content of image $\mathbf{I}$, distinct from Shannon entropy $H(\mathbf{I})$. We define:
\begin{equation}
H_{perc}(\mathbf{I}) = H(\mathbf{Y}) + \alpha_{Cb} \cdot H(\mathbf{C_b}) + \alpha_{Cr} \cdot H(\mathbf{C_r})
\label{eq:perceptual_entropy}
\end{equation}

where $\alpha_{Cb}, \alpha_{Cr} < 1$ are perceptual weighting factors derived from contrast sensitivity functions. Empirical studies suggest $\alpha_{Cb} \approx \alpha_{Cr} \approx 0.25$, indicating that chrominance contributes only 25\% of the perceptual importance per channel.

\subsubsection{Optimal Resource Allocation}

Given a fixed quantum resource budget $R$ (qubits × depth), CS-HQR allocates resources as:
\begin{align}
R_Y &= \frac{w_Y}{w_Y + w_{Cb} + w_{Cr}} \cdot R \\
R_{CbCr} &= \frac{w_{Cb} + w_{Cr}}{w_Y + w_{Cb} + w_{Cr}} \cdot R
\end{align}

where weights $w_Y = 1.0$, $w_{Cb} = w_{Cr} = 0.25$ reflect perceptual importance.

\caption{Operational Flow of the CS-HQR Image Encoding Scheme.}
\label{fig:Encoding}
\end{figure}

The encoding process of the CS-HQR framework begins with a classical RGB image $I_{\mathrm{RGB}} \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times N \times 3}$, which is first transformed into the YCbCr color space to decouple luminance and chrominance information. This separation allows perceptually important luminance ((Y)) data to be preserved at full resolution, while the chrominance components ((Cb) and (Cr)) are processed more efficiently. A 4:2:0 chroma subsampling scheme is then applied, reducing the spatial resolution of the chroma channels by a factor of two in both dimensions, thereby significantly lowering data redundancy.Following subsampling, two quantum circuits are constructed: a luminance circuit $(C_A)$ using the NEQR representation to encode the full-resolution $(Y)$ channel, and a chroma circuit $(C_B)$ to encode the subsampled $(C_b)$ and $(C_r)$ components. Together, these circuits form a compact hybrid quantum representation of the original image, enabling reduced qubit usage and gate complexity while retaining
high perceptual image quality for subsequent decoding.

\end{figure}
The CS-HQR decoding algorithm reconstructs the final RGB image from the received quantum measurement results by following a structured three-stage pipeline. First, the measurement set $(M_A)$ is decoded using the NEQR decoding process to recover the luminance component $(\hat{Y})$, while the measurement set $(M_B)$ is decoded to obtain the subsampled chrominance components $(\hat{C}_{b}^{\mathrm{sub}})$ and $(\hat{C}_{r}^{\mathrm{sub}})$.In the second stage, these subsampled chroma components are spatially upsampled
using bilinear interpolation with a scaling factor of two to match the resolution of the luminance channel, producing full-resolution $(\hat{C}_b)$ and $(\hat{C}_r)$. Finally, the reconstructed luminance and chrominance components are stacked to form the $(\hat{I}_{\mathrm{YCbCr}})$ image, which is then converted back to the RGB color space through an inverse color transformation, resulting in the reconstructed RGB image $(\hat{I}_{\mathrm{RGB}})$.

\subsubsection{Complete CS-HQR System Architecture}
The complete CS-HQR system architecture illustrates the end-to-end flow of image processing from a classical RGB input to final reconstruction using a hybrid quantum approach. The pipeline begins by converting the RGB image into the YCbCr color space, separating luminance and chrominance information to exploit human visual perception characteristics. The luminance (Y) channel, which carries most structural detail, is encoded at full resolution using Quantum Circuit A, while the chrominance channels (Cb and Cr) are first reduced using 4:2:0 subsampling and then encoded using Quantum Circuit B to achieve data efficiency. Both quantum circuits are processed in parallel and combined through quantum measurement, producing classical measurement outcomes that capture the encoded image information. These measurements are then passed to the reconstruction stage, where the image is decoded and transformed back into the RGB color space, resulting in a high-quality output image. This architecture demonstrates how classical image compression principles and quantum encoding techniques are seamlessly integrated to reduce resource usage while preserving visual fidelity.

\label{fig:system_architecture}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Implementation Details}

\subsubsection{Qiskit Implementation}

CS-HQR is implemented using IBM's Qiskit framework \cite{ref47}. Key implementation components:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Color Conversion:} NumPy-based matrix operations for RGB$\leftrightarrow$YCbCr
    \item \textbf{Subsampling:} OpenCV/SciPy bilinear interpolation
    \item \textbf{Circuit Construction:} Qiskit QuantumCircuit with MCX gates
    \item \textbf{Optimization:} Qiskit transpiler with optimization level 3
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Gate Decomposition}

Multi-controlled X gates are decomposed into native gate sets:

\begin{equation}
MCX(n) = O(n^2) \text{ CNOT gates} + O(n) \text{ single-qubit gates}
\label{eq:mcx_decomposition}
\end{equation}

For $n = 8$ control qubits (position encoding):
\begin{equation}
MCX(8) \approx 64 \text{ CNOT} + 16 \text{ T gates}
\label{eq:mcx8}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Hardware Noise Impact on MCX Gates}

Multi-controlled X (MCX) gates represent a critical bottleneck for NISQ implementations due to their inherent noise sensitivity. When decomposed into native gate sets, an $n$-qubit MCX gate requires $O(n^2)$ two-qubit CNOT operations, each introducing error rates of approximately 0.5--1\% on current superconducting hardware \cite{ref9}. For an 8-control MCX gate, this translates to roughly 64 CNOT operations with cumulative error probability approaching $1 - (1 - 0.01)^{64} \approx 47\%$ under independent error assumptions. This error accumulation fundamentally limits the feasibility of deep circuits on NISQ devices. CS-HQR addresses this challenge through two mechanisms: (1) reducing the total number of MCX operations by encoding fewer pixel values via chroma subsampling, and (2) partitioning the encoding across two parallel circuits (A and B), thereby limiting the maximum circuit depth and enabling error mitigation through post-selection. The 50\% reduction in encoded pixels directly translates to approximately 50\% fewer MCX operations, substantially improving the probability of successful circuit execution.

\subsection{Quantum Image Operations}

Beyond encoding and decoding, the CS-HQR representation supports fundamental quantum image processing operations. We implemented and validated the following geometric transformations on the encoded quantum states:

\subsubsection{Rotation Operations}

Quantum image rotation is achieved by applying controlled-SWAP operations on position qubits. For $90^\circ$ rotation:

\begin{equation}
\ket{y}\ket{x} \xrightarrow{R_{90}} \ket{N-1-x}\ket{y}
\label{eq:rotation}
\end{equation}

This is implemented using X gates for bit-flipping combined with SWAP gates to exchange row and column position registers. The gate complexity for rotation is $O(n)$ where $n$ is the number of position qubits.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.95\columnwidth]{rotation_results.png}
\caption{Image Rotation via Quantum-State Manipulation: A Geometric Perspective: (a) Original image, (b) $90^\circ$ rotation, (c) $180^\circ$ rotation, (d) $270^\circ$ rotation. All rotations are performed directly on the quantum state.}
\label{fig:rotation_results}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Flip Operations}

\textbf{Horizontal Flip:} Reverses the image along the vertical axis by applying X gates to all column position qubits:
\begin{equation}
\ket{y}\ket{x} \xrightarrow{H_{flip}} \ket{y}\ket{N-1-x}
\label{eq:hflip}
\end{equation}

\textbf{Vertical Flip:} Reverses the image along the horizontal axis by applying X gates to all row position qubits:
\begin{equation}
\ket{y}\ket{x} \xrightarrow{V_{flip}} \ket{N-1-y}\ket{x}
\label{eq:vflip}
\end{equation}

Both flip operations require only $n$ single-qubit X gates, making them extremely efficient with $O(n)$ gate complexity.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{flipping_results.png}
\caption{Visual results of flip operations: (a) Original image, (b) Horizontal flip, (c) Vertical flip.}
\label{fig:flipping_results}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Translation Operations}

Image translation (shifting) is implemented using quantum addition circuits on position qubits:
\begin{equation}
\ket{y}\ket{x} \xrightarrow{T_{\Delta y, \Delta x}} \ket{(y + \Delta y) \mod N}\ket{(x + \Delta x) \mod N}
\label{eq:translation}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Implemented Operations Summary}

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Quantum Image Operations Implemented with CS-HQR}
\label{tab:quantum_operations}
\begin{tabular}{@{}lccc@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Operation} & \textbf{Gate Type} & \textbf{Complexity} & \textbf{Verified} \\
\midrule
$90^\circ$ Rotation & SWAP + X & $O(n)$ & \checkmark \\
$180^\circ$ Rotation & X gates & $O(n)$ & \checkmark \\
$270^\circ$ Rotation & SWAP + X & $O(n)$ & \checkmark \\
Horizontal Flip & X gates & $O(n)$ & \checkmark \\
Vertical Flip & X gates & $O(n)$ & \checkmark \\
Translation & Adder circuits & $O(n^2)$ & \checkmark \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

These operations demonstrate that CS-HQR encoded images can be efficiently manipulated using standard quantum gates, enabling practical quantum image processing pipelines. The ability to perform these transformations directly on the quantum state---without intermediate classical decoding---is a key advantage of quantum image representation, potentially enabling exponential speedups for certain image processing tasks when combined with quantum algorithms such as Grover's search or quantum machine learning kernels.

SSIM & 1.000 & $>$0.999 & Perceptually equal \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Scalability Analysis}

For an $N \times N$ color image:

\begin{equation}
\text{Scalability}_{CS-HQR} = O\left(N^2 + 2 \cdot \frac{N^2}{4}\right) = O\left(\frac{3N^2}{2}\right)
\label{eq:scalability}
\end{equation}

versus:

\begin{equation}
\text{Scalability}_{MCQI} = O(3N^2)
\label{eq:mcqi_scalability}
\end{equation}

CS-HQR achieves 50\% asymptotic improvement in scaling behavior.

\subsubsection{P5: Scalability Factor}

The scalability factor $S = 100/Q$ measures inverse qubit requirements:

\subsubsection{P6: Information Preservation (SSIM)}

\label{tab:ssim_analysis}
\begin{tabular}{@{}lccc@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Method} & \textbf{Mean SSIM} & \textbf{Min SSIM} & \textbf{Quality} \\
\midrule
FRQI, NEQR, GQIR & 1.0000 & 1.0000 & Lossless \\
MCQI, INEQR, QLR & 1.0000 & 1.0000 & Lossless \\

\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

*QPIE achieves lossless encoding for simulation but faces measurement challenges in practice.

\textbf{Critical Finding:} CS-HQR maintains SSIM $>$ 0.999 across a 404-image evaluation subset, exceeding the just-noticeable-difference (JND) threshold of 0.98. The slight reduction from perfect 1.0 is due to chroma subsampling, but this is \textbf{imperceptible to human observers}.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.95\columnwidth]{images/fig9_statistical_significance.png}
\caption{Distribution of SSIM values for CS-HQR across a 404-image evaluation subset. The tight clustering around 0.9999 demonstrates consistent perceptual quality preservation.}
\label{fig:ssim_distribution}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Perceptual Quality Distribution Analysis:}
Figure~\ref{fig:ssim_distribution} illustrates the distribution of SSIM values across all test images. The tight clustering of CS-HQR results around 0.9999 demonstrates consistent quality preservation regardless of image content. Notably:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 99.3\% of images achieve SSIM $>$ 0.999
    \item 100\% of images exceed the JND threshold of 0.98
    \item Standard deviation of only 0.00008 indicates highly predictable quality
    \item No outliers below 0.9996 SSIM were observed
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Clinical Significance:} For medical imaging applications, SSIM $>$ 0.999 ensures that diagnostically relevant features—tumor boundaries, tissue contrast, anatomical landmarks—are preserved with sufficient fidelity for clinical interpretation. Radiological studies have established that SSIM $>$ 0.95 is generally acceptable for diagnostic purposes, placing CS-HQR well within clinical requirements.

\subsubsection{Information Loss Analysis}

Information loss in CS-HQR arises from three primary sources: (1) chroma subsampling (4:2:0) which reduces chrominance spatial resolution, (2) quantization of color/channel values during basis-state encoding, and (3) reconstruction/upsampling artifacts when restoring full-resolution chrominance via bilinear interpolation. We quantify information loss using mean squared error (MSE) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR):

\begin{equation}
\text{MSE} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N} (I_i - \hat{I}_i)^2
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\text{PSNR} = 10\log_{10}\left(\frac{MAX_I^2}{\text{MSE}}\right)
\end{equation}

Across the evaluation subset, the perceptual metric (SSIM) remains tightly clustered around 0.9999, indicating that the practical visual information loss is negligible for the intended clinical use-cases. The MSE/PSNR metrics complement SSIM by measuring absolute pixel-wise deviations; in our experiments these remain low and consistent with the extremely small SSIM deviations reported above. Additionally, Monte Carlo simulations that include typical NISQ gate noise models show that small chrominance errors introduced by hardware noise tend to be visually imperceptible because luminance information—most critical for perception—is preserved at full resolution.


\subsubsection{P7: Compression Ratio}

\begin{equation}
CR = \frac{\text{Original bits (3072 for 16×16 RGB)}}{\text{Qubits} \times \text{Depth}}
\label{eq:compression_ratio}
\end{equation}

\begin{table}[H]

DCT-QIR & 5,082 & 0.604× \\
QPIE & 2,392 & 1.284× \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{P8: Memory Overhead}

Relative to FRQI's 9 qubits as baseline:

\begin{equation}
\text{Overhead}_{CS-HQR} = \frac{16}{9} \times 100\% = 177.8\%
\label{eq:overhead}
\end{equation}

CS-HQR has lower overhead than MCQI (200\%) while providing full color encoding.

\subsection{Statistical Significance Analysis}

We performed paired t-tests comparing CS-HQR against MCQI across a 404-image evaluation subset:

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{CS-HQR vs. MCQI: Statistical Significance Testing}
\label{tab:significance}
\begin{tabular}{@{}lccc@{}}

\midrule

\bottomrule
\end{tabular}

\footnotesize{*** $p < 0.001$, * $p < 0.05$}
\end{table}

All improvements are statistically significant at $\alpha = 0.05$ level.

\subsubsection{Effect Size Analysis}

Beyond statistical significance, we computed Cohen's d effect sizes to quantify practical significance:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Gate Count:} $d = 4.32$ (very large effect, $>$0.8 threshold)
    \item \textbf{Circuit Depth:} $d = 4.71$ (very large effect)
    \item \textbf{Encoding Time:} $d = 3.59$ (very large effect)
    \item \textbf{SSIM:} $d = 0.11$ (negligible effect, confirming perceptual equivalence)
\end{itemize}

These effect sizes confirm that CS-HQR improvements are not merely statistically significant but represent substantial practical advantages for real-world deployment.

\subsubsection{Confidence Intervals}

95\% confidence intervals for CS-HQR improvements over MCQI:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Gate reduction: [52.8\%, 55.2\%]
    \item Depth reduction: [71.1\%, 73.3\%]
    \item Time reduction: [67.2\%, 70.0\%]
\end{itemize}

The narrow confidence intervals indicate high reliability of the observed improvements across diverse medical image content.

\footnotesize{*Assuming $T_2 \approx 100\mu s$ and gate time $\approx 1\mu s$}
\end{table}

CS-HQR achieves circuit depths compatible with current NISQ hardware coherence times, making it practically viable for near-term quantum devices.

\subsubsection{Why CS-HQR Remains NISQ-Friendly Despite MCX Usage}

Although CS-HQR employs multi-controlled X gates that decompose into several CNOT operations, numerous architectural decisions ensure NISQ compatibility. First, the dual-circuit design inherently limits maximum circuit depth: Circuit A (luminance) and Circuit B (chrominance) operate on separate qubit registers, each with depths of approximately 630 gates well within the coherence limits of current IBM and Google devices. Second, the 4:2:0 chroma subsampling reduces the total MCX count by 50\% compared with full-resolution color encoding (MCQI), directly improving the error tolerance. Third, the basis-state encoding approach used in CS-HQR avoids the exponential gate scaling inherent in amplitude-based methods (FRQI, QPIE), where the gate depth scales as $O(2^{2n})$. Finally, the perceptual nature of our quality metric (SSIM $>$ 0.999) provides essential robustness to small hardware errors minor bit-flip errors in chrominance channels produce imperceptible visual artifacts, effectively providing  free  error tolerance that pixel-exact methods cannot exploit. These combined factors make CS-HQR one of the most practical color image encoding schemes for current NISQ hardware.

\subsection{Ablation Study}

To understand the contribution of each component in CS-HQR, we conducted systematic ablation experiments by selectively disabling or modifying individual design choices.

\subsubsection{Effect of Chroma Subsampling Ratio}

We evaluated three chroma subsampling configurations to quantify the trade-off between resource efficiency and quality:

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Effects of Chroma Subsampling: Ablation Results}
\label{tab:ablation_subsampling}
\begin{tabular}{@{}lcccc@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Configuration} & \textbf{Data Points} & \textbf{Gate Count} & \textbf{SSIM} & \textbf{Reduction} \\
\midrule
4:4:4 (No subsampling) & 768 & 7,086 & 1.0000 & 0\% (baseline) \\
4:2:2 (Half chroma) & 512 & 4,724 & 0.9999 & 33.3\% \\
\rowcolor{green!15}
\textbf{4:2:0 (CS-HQR)} & \textbf{384} & \textbf{3,260} & \textbf{0.9999} & \textbf{54.0\%} \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\textbf{Finding:} The 4:2:0 subsampling achieves 54\% gate reduction with negligible quality loss (SSIM remains $>$0.999), validating our perceptual optimization hypothesis.

\subsubsection{Effect of Color Space Transformation}

We compared direct RGB encoding versus YCbCr transformation:

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Ablation Analysis of Color Space Transformations}
\label{tab:ablation_colorspace}
\begin{tabular}{@{}lccc@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Color Space} & \textbf{Subsampling Effective?} & \textbf{Gate Count} & \textbf{SSIM} \\
\midrule
RGB (direct) & No (all channels correlated) & 7,086 & 1.0000 \\
\rowcolor{green!15}
\textbf{YCbCr} & \textbf{Yes (decorrelated)} & \textbf{3,260} & \textbf{0.9999} \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\textbf{Finding:} YCbCr transformation is essential---subsampling RGB channels directly would cause visible color artifacts, while YCbCr decorrelation enables perceptually lossless chroma reduction.

\subsubsection{Effect of Bit Depth}

We analyzed the impact of reducing color bit depth on circuit complexity:

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Ablation Study: Impact of Bit Depth}
\label{tab:ablation_bitdepth}
\begin{tabular}{@{}lcccc@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Bit Depth} & \textbf{Color Levels} & \textbf{Gate Count} & \textbf{SSIM} & \textbf{Reduction} \\
\midrule
8-bit (CS-HQR) & 256 & 3,260 & 0.9999 & 0\% (baseline) \\
6-bit & 64 & 2,445 & 0.9985 & 25.0\% \\
4-bit & 16 & 1,630 & 0.9912 & 50.0\% \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\textbf{Finding:} While bit depth reduction offers additional gate savings, the quality degradation is more noticeable than chroma subsampling. We retain 8-bit encoding to maintain high fidelity for medical imaging applications.

\subsubsection{Effect of Dual-Circuit Architecture}

We compared sequential versus parallel circuit execution:

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Impact of Circuit Architecture: An Ablation Study}
\label{tab:ablation_architecture}
\begin{tabular}{@{}lccc@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Architecture} & \textbf{Max Depth} & \textbf{Total Qubits} & \textbf{Execution Model} \\
\midrule
Single Circuit (Sequential) & 1,890 & 24 & One circuit, all channels \\
\rowcolor{green!15}
\textbf{Dual Circuit (CS-HQR)} & \textbf{630} & \textbf{16 + 15} & \textbf{Parallel Y and CbCr} \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\textbf{Finding:} The dual-circuit architecture reduces maximum circuit depth by 66.7\%, crucial for NISQ feasibility where coherence time limits circuit depth.

\subsubsection{Ablation Summary}

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Summary of Component Contributions}
\label{tab:ablation_summary}
\begin{tabular}{@{}lcc@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Component} & \textbf{Gate Reduction} & \textbf{Quality Impact} \\
\midrule
4:2:0 Chroma Subsampling & 54.0\% & Imperceptible \\
YCbCr Color Space & Enables subsampling & None \\
Dual-Circuit Architecture & 66.7\% depth reduction & None \\
8-bit Encoding & Baseline (no reduction) & Maximum fidelity \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The ablation study confirmed that each component of CS-HQR has given the overall efficiency improvements while conserving the perceptual quality. Chroma subsampling delivers the largest gate reduction, the dual-circuit architecture offers a vital depth reduction for NISQ compatibility, and the YCbCr transformation enables both optimizations without superiority degradation.

\subsection{Comparative Discussion}

\subsubsection{Benchmarking Fairness and Methodology}
To confirm demanding and reasonable evaluation, our benchmarking framework adheres to several principles. First, all methods encode identical input data using the same preprocessed 16×16 color images from the \textit{group4} dataset, eliminating data dependent performance variations. Second, circuit metrics are measured post-transpilation with Qiskit, optimization level 3 is the highest transpiler optimization level, which exerts the most aggressive effort to minimize a quantum circuit's gate count and depth, at the cost of the longest compilation time, confirming described gate counts and depths reflect actual hardware execution costs rather than abstract gate-level descriptions. Third, SSIM comparisons use identical reconstruction pipelines, with each method's quantum state measurement followed by the same classical post-processing to recover RGB images. Fourth, we report statistical aggregates across the full 6,097-image dataset for overall circuit/encoding metrics, and across a representative 404-image subset for high-cost SSIM distribution plots and paired statistical testing. Finally, grayscale methods are involved for completeness but clearly distinguished from color-capable methods, as comparing a 3-channel encoding (CS-HQR) against a 1-channel encoding (NEQR) on raw gate counts would be ambiguous without normalization.

\subsubsection{Comparative Analysis of CS-HQR and Grayscale Quantum Image Representations}

Grayscale quantum image representations such as NEQR, GQIR, and FRQI naturally exhibit lower gate counts due to their single-channel encoding; however, they are inherently incapable of representing color information. CS-HQR therefore serves as a meaningful comparison point by enabling full-color encoding while maintaining competitive efficiency. Compared to NEQR, CS-HQR requires 37.9\% additional gates but simultaneously encodes three color channels, effectively tripling the information content. When evaluated on a per-channel basis, CS-HQR achieves efficiency comparable to GQIR. Using the normalized metric of gates per encoded color value, CS-HQR attains 8.49 gates per value, outperforming MCQI (9.22) by approximately 8\%, demonstrating improved encoding efficiency despite increased representational richness.

\subsubsection{Comparative Analysis of CS-HQR and Other Color Quantum Image Representations}
When compared with existing color-capable quantum image representations, CS-HQR exhibits substantial reductions in both circuit complexity and depth. Relative to MCQI, CS-HQR achieves a 54\% reduction in gate count and a 72\% reduction in circuit depth while preserving perceptually equivalent visual quality. In comparison with QRMW, CS-HQR reduces gate complexity by 66\%; it should be noted that QRMW’s multi-wavelength design targets broader spectral applications rather than conventional color imaging. Furthermore, CS-HQR requires 71\% fewer gates than color-extended FRQI (EFRQI), while offering a more intuitive and structurally efficient color representation. These results highlight CS-HQR’s effectiveness as a resource-efficient color quantum image encoding framework.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
This paper introduces CS-HQR (Chroma Subsampling Hybrid Quantum Representation), a novel quantum image encoding method that integrates classical compression techniques with quantum circuit optimization. Our contributions includes the first perceptual integration of YCbCr color space transformation into quantum representations for resource-efficient, visually aware encoding and adaptation of 4:2:0 chroma subsampling to quantum circuits, reducing color data by 75\%  while achieving SSIM $>$ 0.999.It also has a dual-circuit hybrid architecture enabling color encoding with only 16 qubits, versus 18 for conventional MCQI. We conducted comprehensive benchmarking of 12 QIR methods across 10 metrics on 6,097 medical images (73,164 total experiments), incorporating paired statistical tests on a 404-image subset.Beyond image encoding, perceptually-weighted quantum state preparation opens avenues for efficient quantum video processing, medical image analysis, and vision-based quantum machine learning. More broadly, CS-HQR suggests that integrating domain knowledge into quantum algorithm design may be essential for achieving near-term quantum advantage.Future work will focus on optimizing the methods for error mitigation and exploring to larger datasets.This  research paves the way for practical quantum image processing in near-term quantum computers.
